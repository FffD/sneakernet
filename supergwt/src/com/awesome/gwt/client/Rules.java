Must have an IMDB link. &nbsp;Your home movies are not acceptable.</div><div>2. There must not be a release of equal or better quality already on the sneakernet (no dupes!) &nbsp;This means if a self-sourced rip exists, no scene releases are allowed.</div><div>3. Must either be scene or ripped by you personally. &nbsp;Good self-rips trump scene releases.</div><div>4. Absolutely no CAMs, TS, or other low-quality files. &nbsp;All files must be DVDRip, R5, DVDScr, or similar quality.</div><div>5. Movies that you rip must be h.264, AC3 audio, two-pass encoding, target file size 1000MB. &nbsp;Absolutely no DIVX, XVID, etc. for self-sourced rips. &nbsp;Ignoring this will get you <b>banned</b>.</div><div>6. Scene releases can be DIVX/XVID, but may be trumped by a self-rip.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><h2><font size=\"4\">Books</font></h2><div>1. &nbsp;PDF format or TXT format only. &nbsp;No HTML, JPG, ePub, or whatever else.</div><div>2. &nbsp;OCR is allowed (and even encouraged) if it's done <b>well</b>. &nbsp;Crappy OCR will get you <b>banned</b>. &nbsp;If you're unsure, don't; someone who's competent might fix it.</div><div><br></div><div><h2><font size=\"4\"><font size=\"4\">Software</font></font></h2></div></div><div>1. &nbsp;All games should be clearly marked as games.</div><div>2. &nbsp;Correct cracks, activations, etc. &nbsp;Should all be working. &nbsp;Non-working releases will get you <b>banned</b>. &nbsp;</div><div>3. &nbsp;Clearly mark what platforms are supported. &nbsp;If you say it supports Linux, it had better support Linux.</div><div><br></div><h1>General Rules</h1><div>Don't do anything to make the ops angry. &nbsp;The ops have final and absolute authority and can bend, break, suspend, enforce, or make up any and all rules.</div><div>If you are banned, the decision is <b>final</b>, and there is <b>no appeal</b>. &nbsp;<b><u>Your membership dues will not be refunded</u></b>. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div>Every time somebody unlocks content you shared (no matter how it got to them), you will be credited 1 point per megabyte of the file size.<div>Every time you unlock/download content (no matter how it got to you), you will be debited one half a point per megabyte of the file size.</div><div><br></div><div>You will be required to make \"runs\" occasionally, usually in connection with either files that you are either sending or receiving. &nbsp;Occasionally points will be offered for these runs, although it is in your best interests to keep the network running smoothly, as it affects your overall score.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Losing a flash drive earns you an instant ban. &nbsp;Don't do it. &nbsp;</b>Always follow the instructions exactly and track drives carefully.</div><div><br></div><div><b><u>Never reveal the location or codes of any caches, ever!</u></b> &nbsp;If someone needs it, the website will tell them where it is and how to open it.</div><div><br></div><div><b><u>Always clear the combinations of the locks! </u></b>&nbsp;The locks do not auto-clear, if you don't clear the combos, they will be stolen, and you will be responsible!</div><div><br></div><div>Membership dues aren't just lining someone's pockets. &nbsp;Sneakernet needs lots and lots of flash drives, CPU power, combination locks, mounting hardware, people to bribe, etc. &nbsp;For the ops to make any money we'd have to be charging double.</div><div><br></div><div>Dues are currently per-semester and may change at any time (for new members) at the discretion of the ops.</div><div><h1><font size=\"5\">Team Leader Rules</font></h1><div>Every team has one or more leaders who administrate the team and are responsible for it. &nbsp;They are compensated (in points) for their duties.</div><div><br></div><h2>Invites</h2><div>Team leaders can invite other members to their team. &nbsp;<b>Dues must be paid to the ops</b>&nbsp;for each new member, no exceptions.</div><div>Review the rules with everyone you invite. &nbsp;<b>I</b><b>f a team member misbehaves, the entire team may be held responsible!</b> &nbsp;Only recruit people who will follow the rules and be good citizens.</div><div><br></div><div><h2><font size=\"4\">Runs</font></h2><div>Team leaders are responsible for doing internal and external runs. &nbsp;Runs are critical to the success of the sneakernet.</div><div><br></div><div>Internal runs are between your local cache location and your own dropbox. &nbsp;These are fairly easy, and only require a few minutes. &nbsp;You should really try to do at least one per day. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>External runs are runs to and from other teams. &nbsp;You should really try to do at least one per day for each team you have an alliance with. &nbsp;This should only take 10-15 minutes. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>NEVER pick up a flash drive unless <b>you</b> (this means <b><i><u>you</u></i></b>) are the one who was supposed to pick it up, and have marked it as such on the site. &nbsp;Any flash drives that go missing on your watch will have serious <b>repercussions for your entire team</b>.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div><h2>Local cache</h2><div>Your local cache will be a locked box that will be located in a common area (lounge, hallway, etc.) and stored out-of-sight. &nbsp;Your team members will use this cache to retrieve files from the system. <b>&nbsp;You should never reveal the location or codes to a local cache to anyone, ever!</b> &nbsp;If someone needs it, the website will tell them where it is.</div><div><br></div><h2>External cache</h2></div><div>This cache is located outside your physical building in a locked box. &nbsp;Bike racks are typically a good choice. &nbsp;<b>You should never reveal the location or codes to an external cache, ever!</b> &nbsp; If someone needs it, the website will tell them where it is.</div><div><br></div><br>";
